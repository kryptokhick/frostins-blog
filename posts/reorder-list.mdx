# Reordering Lists with Chakra-UI

## About This Tutorial

This tutorial is designed first-and-foremost as a proof of concept for highlighly interactive tutorials.

As you can see on the right side of the screen, there's an interactive playground that we'll be using to demonstrate code.

Throughout the tutorial you will see buttons like this: <FileAction path="/package.json" action="open" />

When you click them, they will perform operations on the sandbox on the right side of the screen.
The buttons in this paragraph will open the specified file in the editor. For example, the following button will open <FileAction path="/App.js" action="open" /> and this next one will open <FileAction path="/package.json" action="open" />.

## Objective

Chakra UI is an awesome component library and it couples nicely with framer-motion, an awesome animation library.

Today I'm going to show you how to turn a boring static list into a spicy reorderable list while preserving code-readability.

## Ok, Let's Do It

To get us started, I've already gone ahead and implemented a basic list of usernames using chakra-ui's style props.
We're going to add to this implementation throughout the tutorial to make it more interesting.

```jsx path="/App.js"
import { Center, ChakraProvider, List, ListItem, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [usernames, setUsernames] = useState([
    "malerba118",
    "compulves",
    "dan_abramov",
  ]);
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Center h="100vh">
        <List spacing={2}>
          {usernames.map((username) => (
            <ListItem key={username} p={2} bg="gray.100" rounded="lg">
              <Text>{username}</Text>
            </ListItem>
          ))}
        </List>
      </Center>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}
```

The list is super boring right now so let's go ahead and add an avatar for each user.
We've already included a package `react-jazzicon` in the <FileAction path="/package.json" action="open" /> file, which will allow us to render cool avatars.

Let's make a new file, <FileAction action="add" path="/User.jsx" />, and in here we'll put a user component.

```jsx path="/User.jsx"
import { HStack, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import React from "react";
import Jazzicon from "react-jazzicon";
import hash from "hash-it";

const User = ({ username }) => {
  return (
    <HStack>
      <Jazzicon diameter={32} seed={hash(username)} />
      <Text>{username}</Text>
    </HStack>
  );
};

export default User;
```

Even after applying these changes, we won't see any diffence in the ui yet because we're not using the `User` component anywhere.

So now let's import `User` in `App.js` and render it within the `ListItem`.

```jsx path="/App.js"
import { Center, ChakraProvider, List, ListItem, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { useState } from "react";
import User from "./User";

export default function App() {
  const [usernames, setUsernames] = useState([
    "malerba118",
    "compulves",
    "dan_abramov",
  ]);
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Center h="100vh">
        <List spacing={2}>
          {usernames.map((username) => (
            <ListItem key={username} p={2} bg="gray.100" rounded="lg">
              <User username={username} />
            </ListItem>
          ))}
        </List>
      </Center>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}
```

Sweet, now that we've got a better looking list, let's try to make it interactive. To do this we'll user framer-motion's `Reorder.Group` and `Reorder.Item` components.

Strictly using framer-motion we could implement a reorderable list as follows.

```jsx
import { Reorder } from "framer-motion";
import { useState } from "react";

function List() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([0, 1, 2, 3]);

  return (
    <Reorder.Group axis="y" values={items} onReorder={setItems}>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Reorder.Item key={item} value={item}>
          {item}
        </Reorder.Item>
      ))}
    </Reorder.Group>
  );
}
```

However, then we would lose the ability to style our components using chakra-ui.

So instead, we'll use the `as` prop on our chakra components to render framer-motion's reorder components under the hood.

```jsx path="/App.js"
import { Center, ChakraProvider, List, ListItem } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { Reorder } from "framer-motion";
import { useState } from "react";
import User from "./User";

export default function App() {
  const [usernames, setUsernames] = useState([
    "malerba118",
    "compulves",
    "dan_abramov",
  ]);
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Center h="100vh">
        <List
          as={Reorder.Group}
          axis="y"
          values={usernames}
          onReorder={setUsernames}
          spacing={2}
        >
          {usernames.map((item) => (
            <ListItem
              as={Reorder.Item}
              key={item}
              value={item}
              p={2}
              bg="gray.100"
              rounded="xl"
            >
              <User username={item} />
            </ListItem>
          ))}
        </List>
      </Center>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}
```

Now, if you play around with the rendered list in the sandbox you'll notice that the list can be reordered and will animate smoothly.

By using the `as` prop we're effectively able to combine the behaviors of two components into one.

We've kept all of our list styling props, but are now also passing reorder props to the list components.

However there's still some details that don't quite feel right.
For example, while dragging an element sometimes it will go behind adjacent elements.
Another issue is that the animation speed is rather slow and sluggish. Yet another issue is that when we hover over the elements, they don't _feel_ interactive even though they are.

Let's start by addressing the slow animation speed.

We can use the `dragTransition` prop to control the transition characteristics. Let's see how changing the `bounceStiffness` affects the feeling of the animation. Try clicking each option below and then reordering the list to see how the animation feels.

<HStack my={8}>
  <FileAction
    action="update"
    path="/App.js"
    code={getAppWithCustomStiffness(50)}
    label="bounceStiffness: 50"
  />
  <FileAction
    action="update"
    path="/App.js"
    code={getAppWithCustomStiffness(700)}
    label="bounceStiffness: 700"
  />
  <FileAction
    action="update"
    path="/App.js"
    code={getAppWithCustomStiffness(2500)}
    label="bounceStiffness: 2500"
  />
</HStack>

You probably noticed that a `bounceStiffness` of 700 feels most appropriate, so that's what we'll stick with!
